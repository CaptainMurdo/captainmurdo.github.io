title: Neobanked - 007 Building out propositions
---

The neobanks continue to broaden their customer propositions.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 007 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any initial thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

The markets may be in turmoil but the neobanks are still aggressively pushing forward with their products. The current global situation may in fact be an accelerator for the digital-only propositions as it becomes more difficult to access in-person services and cash becomes a literal health hazard.
