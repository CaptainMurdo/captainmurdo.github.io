title: Neobanked - 009 SME banking 

---

A quiet week; most of the focus goes to supporting UK businesses.

---

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 009 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

## New and upcoming feature releases

No major announcements from the main neobanks. Instead a quick note about Plum’s new cashback feature.

### [Plum launches cashback for Pro users](https://blog.withplum.com/plum-cashback/)
Plum, the savings and investment app, has announced its cashback feature, a system that rewards you whenever you shop with their partner merchants through the Plum app. Initial partners include ASOS and Trainline with more to be announced. 

Plum currently has little involvement in customers’ transactional spending; this might signal a shift in strategy to broaden their offering.

## Analysis

I’ve personally written a couple of pieces recent looking at current accounts (aka checking accounts) and potential models for the future.

### [Thinking About Current Accounts](https://www.murdo.xyz/current-account-thinking/)
Digital doesn’t replace cash; it replaces card - the app is now your product.

### [The Current Account Plus Marketplace Business Model](https://www.murdo.xyz/pca-marketplace-model/)
The model makes sense in theory but faces challenges in reality.

A much quieter week as a result of the Easter holidays during a pandemic. I’d welcome a slight strategic shift from the BCR to instead push for the £100m to be used to support small and medium sized businesses more directly; awarding fintech lenders and loosening the restrictions on capital would go a long way to doing so.
