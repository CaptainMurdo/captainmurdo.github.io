Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 016 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

## News this week

### [Plum raises $10m as the app receives a design overhaul](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/plum-raises-10m/)
This funding brings their total to nearly $20m as they eye up expansion across Europe. The app’s overhaul brings it closer to being a holistic financial control centre; users can now link multiple bank accounts, open a savings account with 0.6% interest, and within the year they hope to launch pensions and stock purchasing. Users in France, Ireland, and Spain can [join a beta](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkuKqzijrK28CcxFKCGaDzcaBfxU53G4jT63TZLWdYLUijpA/viewform) for early access to the new European account linking.

It’s been a busy few week’s for Monzo and Revolut, as their proposition continues to mature. Revolut is perhaps the more forward thinking of the two, providing users with services they didn’t even know they’d need. Both still have major propositional gaps in mortgages, long term investments, and advice - this will likely remain the biggest barrier to customer switching from the large, traditional banks.
