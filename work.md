I like designing and developing digital products and services. I'm usually some combination of user researcher, product owner, business analyst and service designer. Below is a selection of projects I've worked on.

## User Research & Service Design 
### Devolved Government
I was the user research lead for the discovery phase of a digital service design project ([Digital Marketplace opportunity information](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/5443)). At the outset I was responsible for ethics approval before conducting the user research interviews and sense-making analysis to allow the team to move into the design of the service blueprint and prototype digital catalogue.

Once we completed our discovery phase I transitioned to service design lead, supported by a team of four business analysts, two designers and a technical architect. I led them through the agile delivery of the prototype digital catalogue, including mock-ups and Axure RP wireframe builds, iterating this based on further user testing and ultimately delivering a detailed service design. 

The service and catalogue were designed and built using the [Scottish Approach to Service Design](http://designwithscotland.scot), the mygov.scot [Design Standards](https://resources.mygov.scot/design-standards/) and the UK Government Digital Services's [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). Throughout the project we used tools like personas, journey mapping and sense-making to conduct our research and communicated our findings to the organisation through show and tells and our research wall. The final prototype catalogue was built in HTML, CSS, and JS using Bootstrap.

Directly responsible for workshop facilitation in order to map and document various customer journeys and service processes to understand the key pain points. Journey maps and future service design was integral to the overall pilot business case and cost-benefit analysis.
