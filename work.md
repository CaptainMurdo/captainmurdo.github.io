I like designing and developing digital services. I'm usually some combination of user researcher, product owner, business analyst and service designer. Below is a selection of projects I've worked on.

---

## User Research & Service Design 
### Devolved Government
User research lead for the Discovery phase of a digital service design project. Responsible for ethics approval, user research interviews and sense-making analysis to inform design of the service blueprint and prototype digital catalogue.
Transitioned to service design lead with a team of four business analysts leading them through agile delivery of the catalogue, including mock-ups and prototyping, ultimately delivering a detailed service design. Service and catalogue were designed and built using the Scottish Approach to Service Design and the GDS Digital Service Standard.

## Business Analysis & Service Design 
### Local Authority
Business analyst for a digital transformation pilot for early years childcare. Directly responsible for workshop facilitation in order to map and document various customer journeys and service processes to understand the key pain points. Journey maps and future service design was integral to the overall pilot business case and cost-benefit analysis. A minimum of 20% reduction in time per visit, with a further 60% identified for validation.

## Digital Strategy 
### Global Insurance Firm
Researched future mobile technologies to modernise the company’s mobile strategy. Findings were presented to the divisional SVP and were vital to the organisation’s future digital roadmap.
Consulted on the development of a new iOS and Android application for customers. Provided a fresh perspective to design the optimal feature set.
