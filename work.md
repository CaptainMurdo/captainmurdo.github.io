I like designing and developing digital products and services. I'm usually some combination of service designer, user researcher, product owner, and business analyst. Below is a selection of projects I've worked on.

## User Research & Service Design 
### Devolved Government
I was the user research lead for the discovery phase of a digital service design project ([Digital Marketplace opportunity information](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/5443)). At the outset I was responsible for ethics approval before conducting the user research interviews and sense-making analysis to allow the team to move into the design of the service blueprint and prototype digital catalogue.

Once we completed our discovery phase I transitioned to service design lead, supported by a team of four business analysts, two designers and a technical architect. I led them through the agile delivery of the prototype digital catalogue, including requirements gathering, mock-ups and Axure RP wireframe builds, iterating this based on further user testing and ultimately delivering a detailed service design. 

The service and catalogue were designed and built using the [Scottish Approach to Service Design](http://designwithscotland.scot), the mygov.scot [Design Standards](https://resources.mygov.scot/design-standards/) and the UK Government Digital Services's [Digital Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). Throughout the project we used tools like personas, journey mapping and sense-making to conduct our research, requirements gathering and user stories for the technical build and communicated our findings to the organisation through show and tells and our research wall. The final prototype catalogue was built in HTML, CSS, and JS using Bootstrap.

## Business Analysis & Service Design 
### Local Authority
Business analyst for a digital transformation pilot for early years childcare. Directly responsible for workshop facilitation in order to map and document various customer journeys and service processes to understand the key pain points. Journey maps and future service design was integral to the overall pilot business case and cost-benefit analysis. A minimum of 20% reduction in time per visit, with a further 60% identified for validation.

## User Experience Review & Business Case Development 
### Social Housing Association
Throughout this project I was user experience lead. I developed a collection of user personas based on current state customer journey mapping, user research interviews and user observations. From this, our team analysed the key user pain points and motiviations to articulate a vision for the organisation's future digital strategy. The outline business cases we developed estimated over £1m in savings per annum and the transformation programme was approved by the executive team on this basis.

I also delivered a comprehensive usability review of the organisation's desktop and mobile (iOS and Android) web experiences, providing comparison to their peer group and recommendations to align with good practice UX. This was based on key user stories and includes aspects such as accessibility, performance and content design.

## Digital Strategy 
### Global Insurance Firm
Researched future mobile technologies to modernise the company’s mobile strategy. Findings were presented to the divisional SVP and were vital to the organisation’s future digital roadmap.
Consulted on the development of a new iOS and Android application for customers. Provided a fresh perspective to design the optimal feature set.
