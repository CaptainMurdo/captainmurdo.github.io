Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a theory about consumption and what drives people's decision making. The concept was fully crystallised in Clayton Christensen’s book, [The Innovator’s Solution](http://www.businesstraining.com.mx/egaii/docs/The%20Innovators%20Solution.pdf). 

The central premise of JTBD:
**Customers don't just buy a product; they “hire” them to do a job.**

At a high level, it asserts three things:

1. People don't simply buy/use product and services, they "hire" them to get a job done in their life
2. People encounter situations that drive and shape their need for these "jobs“
3. People have criteria (often unconscious) to evaluate the success of a job

INTRO

**Functional** - The tasks that people seek to accomplish

**Emotional** - The way people want to feel in a given circumstance

**Social** - How people want to be perceived by others

| Methods for research | Likely outputs |
|---|---|
| User interviews <br>Fields studies <br>Diary studies <br>Contextual enquiry <br>Participatory design | User insight reports <br>Personas / empathy maps <br>Journey maps <br>Service blueprints <br>Value proposition canvas |


| Pros | Cons |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| - Design is based on real user needs<br>- Interviews are typically quite lightweight and conversational<br>- Jobs can replace personas or increase the quality/depth of them | - Not as effective in B2B situations<br>- Reliance on users’ memories<br>- Specific contextual items can be missed |
