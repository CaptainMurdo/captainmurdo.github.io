Design is a dynamic and rapidly evolving ecosystem, with many systems, frameworks, and methods used across all industries. And it will continue to evolve as new devices, interfaces, and customer needs emerge. 

I wanted to highlight the three types of design I believe to be persistent across industries and enduring over time. Beyond these three (and even within these three) are a multitude of other levels and lenses of design, but for me these capture the most holistic view of design. 

Clear and distinct definitions help me properly frame the problem at hand and design a more appropriate solution as a result. 

### Brand

The overarching identity, positioning, and perception of a company that is used in order to differentiate and market products or services. Brand design is typically communicated through icons/logos, tone of voice, colours, etc. Through brand marketing, companies seek to build or sustain mindshare.

One of my favourite examples of this from a sector I work in regularly is Monzo. Their Hot Coral is instantly recognisable throughout the U.K. and features in big and small ways within their other touch points, whether that's their brand mascot [Hot Chip](https://monzo.com/hotchip/) or the Hot Coral trim on the [Monzo Plus cards](https://community.monzo.com/t/sneak-peek-pick-a-card-any-card-monzo-plus/64560/113).

### Service

The delivery of value to a customer through an orchestrated set of processes, sometimes delivered by people and often supported by technology. Services involve the delivery of intangible value to fulfil the customer need. Services can also involve delivery of one or more products throughout the experience.

To me, nothing showcases this more than Uber. The company is targeting all modes of transportation, both consumer and commercial, and provides a service of intangible value. Uber aggregates consumer demand and aligns it to the preferred mode of transport, masking the complexity of dispatch, logistical coordination, and payment processes.

### Product

The process of efficient and effective idea generation and development with the goal of creating new products - including design, engineering, and manufacturing - to meet the level of quality required in a cost effective manner.

Products follow the lifecycle of:

Introduction ⟶ Growth ⟶ Maturity ⟶ Decline

S curve? Maybe the most understood?

Digital cameras?
