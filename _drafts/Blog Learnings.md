I recently set out to rebuild my (this) blog using more open web standards, whilst learning a thing or two along the way. Inspired by a friend, I wanted to figure out a bit of CSS, explore Markdown and dust off some HTML skills. 

The blog you're reading this on is the work in progress (and will continue to be, so you can judge for yourself as to how I'm doing. Regardless, I learned some interesting things during set-up and wanted to pass them along in case they help others.
