Social networks provide powerful platforms for businesses and customers to interact. However, to ensure an effective return on investment, the platforms used by businesses should be carefully considered. 

With almost 90% of UK adults accessing online services, and most also using social media in some form, these platforms offer cost-effective solutions for organisations looking to engage customers. 
In the UK the most widely used social network is Facebook, across most metrics. A number of Facebook-owned properties also feature very highly in usage reports, such as WhatsApp and Instagram.
The other major platform in the UK is Twitter, with almost half of online adults using the service at least once, but the daily user rate is far below that of Facebook. 
A number of smaller networks, such as Snapchat and Pinterest, have around 25% of online UK adults using them. These often appeal to specific demographics or customer use cases, e.g. Millennials. 
With so many options available, organisations should consider the demographics and behaviours of their existing customer base (or target market for new products/services) and use this to inform their approach – each platform provides distinct tools and these should be used to best reach the organisation’s customers.

Before an organisation invests in a social media strategy it is critical that they understand how their own customers use social media – organisations must meet their customers where they are.
