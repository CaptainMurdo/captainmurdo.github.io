Digital customer engagement is primarily achieved through PC or mobile. It is therefore useful to understand and evaluate the usage trends and of both.
  
Accessing the internet is typically achieved using PCs but over the last five years smartphone usage has doubled within the UK, reaching 70% penetration in 2016.
Ofcom research indicates that younger users tend to use mobile devices and this group is more likely to use only a smartphone to access the internet. The same trend is also seen in lower income groups, where 1 in 10 use only a smartphone.
As expected, nearly 100% of younger users regularly access the internet but this high usage begins to drop off with the 65+ group. This group is much less likely to have access to the internet and only 1 in 3 use a smartphone.
When determining their digital future roadmap, an organisation should consider the trends within their customer demographic and design accordingly. It is likely that customers will follow similar patterns to the overall population trends.

Typical barriers to internet usage, as described by non-users:
Cost
Capability
Lack of interest
Digital inclusion is a prominent initiative across many organisations and it has broadly been successful. Trends show increasing adoption and usage across all age groups and most users can perform basic activities, such as email, banking and document upload/download.

Social networks provide powerful platforms for businesses and customers to interact. However, to ensure an effective return on investment, the platforms used by businesses should be carefully considered. 

With almost 90% of UK adults accessing online services, and most also using social media in some form, these platforms offer cost-effective solutions for organisations looking to engage customers. 
In the UK the most widely used social network is Facebook, across most metrics. A number of Facebook-owned properties also feature very highly in usage reports, such as WhatsApp and Instagram.
The other major platform in the UK is Twitter, with almost half of online adults using the service at least once, but the daily user rate is far below that of Facebook. 
A number of smaller networks, such as Snapchat and Pinterest, have around 25% of online UK adults using them. These often appeal to specific demographics or customer use cases, e.g. Millennials. 
With so many options available, organisations should consider the demographics and behaviours of their existing customer base (or target market for new products/services) and use this to inform their approach – each platform provides distinct tools and these should be used to best reach the organisation’s customers.

Before an organisation invests in a social media strategy it is critical that they understand how their own customers use social media – organisations must meet their customers where they are.
