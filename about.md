I help organisations rethink their customer experiences and design digital services. I typically work as a user researcher or product/service design lead. You can learn more about my work [here](/work.md/). I'm usually based in Edinburgh, Scotland, but my work takes me places.

I studied Actuarial Science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and have since gained my [CIMA/CGMA](https://www.cimaglobal.com/Members/Your-Membership-Information/The-CGMA-Designation/) qualification. I know a thing or two about [agile](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/mconnochie) as well.

I enjoy technology, coffee, and podcasts.

I live with my fianc√©e, Michelle, and our two chihuahua's, Belle and Meeko.
