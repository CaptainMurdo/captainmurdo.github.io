Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, I am a Management Consultant helping clients design their customer experiences and digital services. This is a collection of my thoughts, work and other musings.

I studied Actuarial Science at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh and have since gained my CIMA qualification.

I am fascinated by technology’s ability to transform customer experience and unlock new business models. I typically work as a user researcher or product/service design lead. I have worked across Government, Social Housing, Transport, Higher Education, Banking, and Insurance.

I enjoy technology, coffee, and reading.

I live with my fiancée, Michelle, and our two chihuahua's, Belle and Meeko.
