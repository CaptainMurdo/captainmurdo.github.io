Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, I help organisations rethink their customer experiences and design digital services. 

I studied Actuarial Science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and have since gained my CIMA qualification. I know a thing or two about agile as well.

I typically work as a user researcher or product/service design lead. You can learn more about my work [here](/work.md/).

I enjoy technology, coffee, and reading.

I live with my fianc√©e, Michelle, and our two chihuahua's, Belle and Meeko.
