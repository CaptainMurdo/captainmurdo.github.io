Some neobanks simplify while adjacent fintechs expand.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 015 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

The opportunity for non-banking fintechs (like TransferWise, Plum, and Curve) to build a customer relationship by solving a very specific pain point and leverage that into a wider banking relationship is one of the biggest competitive threats to the larger neobanks. Indirect competition from these fintechs may sneak up on the neobanks and slowly steal use cases, and ultimately users. 

Super apps like Revolut’s recent release may be the most sustainable source of competitive advantage, rather than highly focused offerings like Monzo.
