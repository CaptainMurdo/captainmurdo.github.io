title: Neobanked - 004 A maturing market
---

The bigger neobanks prepare for further global expansion and the smaller ones expand locally.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 004 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any initial thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

Brexit’s impact is beginning to be felt by the neobanks but internationalisation remains a top priority. Ireland is likely to benefit from the newly created borders. For some, there is still plenty of work to do in proving the UK model works and building the product portfolio and brand to appeal to a wider customer base.
