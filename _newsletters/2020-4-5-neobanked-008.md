---

Neobanks outline their coronavirus response as fintech has a unique opportunity to help.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 008 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

The current global situation provides a unique opportunity for many well placed fintechs and neobanks. They should be doing all they can to demonstrate their versatility and flexibility, not just in supporting customers and businesses to survive but through propositional development to help them thrive. Revolut has taken steps to provide alternatives to their customer base; Starling and Monzo are focused more on vulnerable customers and their immediate needs. We need both over the next few months.
