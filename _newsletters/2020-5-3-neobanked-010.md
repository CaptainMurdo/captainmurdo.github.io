title: Neobanked - 010 Emerging from COVID-19 

---

The neobanks return their focus to growth and proposition development.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 010 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

Monzo applied for their license on April 20th, a key step to offering a full range of banking services.

We’re now seeing many firms emerge from the initial COVID-19 shock, implement short term support to ease customer pain, and  refocus their attention on future growth. 

Many predicted this would be the year where the large banks begin acquiring the neobanks. So far the neobanks’ digital propositions have come out stronger and the sub-par digital outfits of the traditional banks not meeting immediate customer needs.
