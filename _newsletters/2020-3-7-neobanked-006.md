Scale is becoming a key feature of the best neobanks, both in terms of capital and user growth.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 006 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any initial thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

The more I think about the fintech and neobank ecosystem, the more I feel it will result in a rainforest-like ecosystem; there will be a proliferation of small shrubs (fintechs) on the forest floor that fill the gaps and cracks left by the large canopy trees (neobanks). Revolut and Monzo are now getting to such a scale that I can feel confident betting they’ll feature as part of the canopy. We’ll have to wait and see who breaks out to become the emergent layer. 

Additionally some of these shrubs may start as newly built products but they may ultimately find themselves subsumed by the trees as features - credit scores are an early example of this.
