Global expansion and product closures.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 020 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

## News this week

### [Revolut launches in Japan](https://blog.revolut.com/konnichiwa-japan/)
Now available in over 35 countries, Revolut will add the full suite of products to Japanese accounts in the coming months. My thesis remains: at a certain scale, Revolut will become a private global payments network; a no brainer if customers need to transfer money internationally. 

### [Tandem closes credit card products](https://sifted.eu/articles/tandem-slowdown-credit-card/)
The challenger offered credit cards and savings products from launch, with a closed book of mortgages purchased from Harrods Bank. They will now close the credit card line after switching to a subscription proposition that proved unprofitable. Tandem will now focus on growth of savings deposits and new lending products.

### [Monzo discusses their approach to financial abuse](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/financial-abuse-banks-monzo)
With a rise in financial / economic abuse throughout the pandemic, many customers are seeking support from their financial institutions. There remains lots to be done but Monzo discusses how they’ve approached this delicate area.

## New and upcoming feature releases

### [Numbrs pivots their business model](https://www.numbrs.com/en-uk/numbrs-adjusts-business-model-100-neutral-financial-analysis-and-subscription-service/)
Previously monetised through commission for product referrals,  (the bank account aggregation and insights app) will now become a subscription service with “100% neutral and bank-independent financial analysis”. The new proposition will first roll-out in Germany and the UK in Q4 2020.

### [Starling launches kid-focused debit card, named Kite](https://www.starlingbank.com/current-account/kite-debit-card-for-kids/)
Aimed at children aged 6-16, the Kite card is linked to a parent / guardian account and costs £2 per month. The card isn’t a full bank account but has full budgeting, notifications, and merchant blocking functionality and is FSCS protected by the main account.

Tandem, Monzo, Starling, and Revolut were the founding UK neobanks - representing a shift in the banking model and inspiring countless others. Tandem’s highly differentiated strategy was a bold bet that didn’t pan out. The others have seen tremendous growth, achieving strong product-market fit, but now face very different challenges.
