title: Neobanked - 017 An apparition of neos 

---

More neobanks are coming, as Monzo faces challenges.

---

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 017 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

## New and upcoming feature releases

### [Lanistar Bank beta opens](https://iamlanistar.com/)
Not much is known about Lanistar at the moment but beta access requires only an email address. Lanistar will leverage “open banking and polymorphic technology”, whatever that means.

The Dutch bank has set aside €100m of deposits to lend to mortgage seekers in the Netherlands. Sticky with their focus on user control, Bunq customers can choose to invest their savings in mortgages.

With Monzo trying to keep afloat through COVID-19, it’s interesting to see a number of new neobank’s launching. Lanistar, Sync, and Frost are all taking initial sign-ups and Open Banking is a key part of their propositions. The large neobanks haven’t seen a massively positive customer response from their Open Banking integrations and marketplace models have failed to gain traction. Perhaps it was due to timing, but more likely it’s a result of poor product-market fit.
