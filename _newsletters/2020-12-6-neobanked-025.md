title: Neobanked - 025 The one where Revolut launches everything

---

The neobank dominates product releases in the final weeks of the year.

Throughout 2020 I'll be publishing a newsletter called Neobanked. Issue 025 is below and you can subscribe [here](https://neobanked.substack.com). Any thoughts or ideas are always welcome, [get in touch](murdo.connochie@gmail.com)!

Welcome to Neobanked, a newsletter focused on the quickly evolving UK digital banking market. I hope to gather enough interesting tidbits and news to share this every two weeks.

For me, Neobanks are digital-only offerings that apply internet economics (i.e. zero marginal costs) to the banking sector. My focus will be on companies such as Monzo, Revolut, and Starling. 

Through this newsletter I hope to cover each of these companies as they continue to grow within the UK and beyond. Some of the regular features will include user number growth, new product/feature releases, and links to relevant interviews and analysis.

## New and upcoming feature releases

### [Revolut redesigns standard cards](https://cdn.brandfolder.io/36T1FNCB/at/nppk69vwg8nfnc2ckjjcxhh/standard-v3.gif)
The new card design incorporates their refreshed logo, bringing it inline with the Premium and Metal tiers.

### [Revolut launches desktop web experience](https://blog.revolut.com/introducing-the-revolut-web-app/)
Over time, the neobanks continue to shift away from their initial app-only strategy. And now Revolut’s done the same; the web app allows users to view transactions and balances, top-up, manage their cards, and request support.

### [Revolut launches business payments solution](https://www.revolut.com/business/online-payments)
Competing with the likes of Stripe, Adyen, and Braintree, their new payments platform gives businesses next day settlement and lower fees across 14 currencies.

### And a smattering of smaller features of the last few months adds to Revolut’s growing super-app
They’ve recently added: 
- [Salary advance](https://blog.revolut.com/get-your-salary-early/), giving users their salary the day before traditional payday
- Users can block upcoming [subscription payments](https://blog.revolut.com/take-control-of-your-subscriptions/), simplifying subscription cancellation
- Parents can set [goals](https://blog.revolut.com/motivate-your-kids-to-save-with-junior-goals/) for Junior accounts
- In-app cryptocurrency news feeds

Likely as a result of their bespoke infrastructure and global scale, Revolut is able to deliver significant customer-facing changes at pace - not to mention, across both personal and business banking portfolios. Their foray into business payments is anticipated to be the first of many products / services to compete with the dozens on global payments processors and gateways; Revolut’s tightly integrated offering and pervasive brand may provide them with a clearer route to growth than most.
